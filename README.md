# E-challenge - Prediction Models for Historical Data of ESP Patterns

This project contains all the material, data, code an solutions of the E-challenge Machine Learning Contest organized by the SPE Ecuador Section on 2021, it is released under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license rights only for academic purposes. 

## Description

Data directory contains two compressed files called Train and Test, each one contains High Frequency records of ESP Pumps from 2019 to 2021, also you will find historical production data about this field. The goal will be to predict the label ['WellFailure'] for testing data, i.e., you have to predict when an event ('yes' or 'Manual off') will occur based on your training.

 - 'yes' refers to a Fail event in the pump.

 - 'Manual off' refers to a Reconditioning event.

Remember, you are free to use any library and open-source framework written in Python for this challenge.
